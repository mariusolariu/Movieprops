Movieprops.com - "Web Dev" course project
=========================================
You have been contracted by a new start-up company to deliver a web site to the public. The company is called movieprops.com and will provide original movie props and costumes to the public (think Utility Belt from Batman, Mark III Armour Suit from Iron Man, Time Travelling DeLorean from Back To The Future,...). It is up to you to develop the branding (logos, color scheme, etc) as well as deliver the technical site itself. While the site is not directly an online store, it should provide information about several of the company’s products and a system for potential customers to register their interest. These customers’ details should be stored in a database and be accessible in a private section of the site. Note: This is an intentionally silly subject. The aim is for you to produce a web site with fun content, making the project more enjoyable.

Requirements
------------
Your site must have a consistent look and feel, with a persistent logo and navigation section. You should include the following pages:
• A home page that is clean, good looking and enticing to customers.
• An about-us page that provides fictional text about the company’s history and
philosophy.
• Product pages that provide details for at least six products.
• A registration page that lets potential customers register their interest.
• An administration page that displays the details of those who have registered.
