				The filmmaking process requires that multiples be made of all principal props and costumes. This is standard practice for a variety of production and continuity reasons. First and foremost, filmmaking is an expensive process, and a production cannot risk unnecessary delays due to having the only version of a prop or costume damaged on set, so they will always have back-ups in place. Multiple versions may also be required for continuity purposes. For instance, a particular garment may need to be distressed as the story progresses. To that end, different versions of that garment will exist so that it can be filmed out of sequence and the story’s continuity will remain in-tact once the film is edited and put together.
Props are frequently made in a variety of different versions. There is typically a hero or beauty prop for close up shots. These tend to be made of better materials, whereas lightweight versions will also be made for stunt and safety work that typically don’t need to hold up to close visual scrutiny. In other cases, props may need to have functionality to them. These special effects props can have moving parts (i.e., a retractable blade for a “stabbing” sword or knife) or even working lights.
Different takes of the same scene may also utilize multiple different examples of a prop or costume, meaning a piece could have been shot but still not make it to the final cut.
